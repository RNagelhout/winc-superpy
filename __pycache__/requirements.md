Requirements

Code

Be creative with your implementation! We intentionally keep the specification open to encourage you to be creative with this project. However, to obtain a passing grade, you will at least need to satisfy the following requirements:


Well-structured and documented code, including: 

Clear and effective variable and function names;
Use of comments where the code does not speak for itself;
Clear and effective separation of code into separate functions and possibly files.

Use of modules to the extent that it shows that you were able to independently read and understand the documentation, and apply the techniques within:

csv
argparse
datetime, including, in particular, the date object, strftime and strptime functions and datetime arithmetic using timedelta.

Use of external text files (CSV) to read and write data.


A well-structured and user-friendly command-line interface with clear descriptions of each argument in the --help section.


A text file containing a usage guide aimed at peers as the target audience. The usage guide should include plenty of examples.


The application must support: 

Setting and advancing the date that the application perceives as 'today';
Recording the buying and selling of products on certain dates;
Reporting revenue and profit over specified time periods;
Exporting selections of data to CSV files;
Two other additional non-trivial features of your choice, for example:
The use of an external module Rich(opens in a new tab) to improve the application.
The ability to import/export reports from/to formats other than CSV (in addition to CSV).
The ability to visualize some statistics using Matplotlib(opens in a new tab) .
Another feature that you thought of.
